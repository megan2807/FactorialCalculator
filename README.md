# Factorial Calculator C++ Program

This is a simple C++ console application that demonstrates how to implement and use a function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.

## How it Works

The program defines a function named `facto` that takes one integer argument `n`. Inside this function, it calculates `n!` (n factorial) by iteratively multiplying numbers from 1 up to `n`. The result is then returned by the function.

The `main` function then prompts the user to enter a value for n and calls `facto` (e.g., 6) and prints the result to the console.

## Example Usage

If `facto(6)` is called, the calculation is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

Expected Output:
The factorial of n = 720

## Getting Started

To compile and run this program:

1.  **Save the code**: Save the C++ code (from `main.cpp`) in a directory.
2.  **Compile**: Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the source file:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o factorial_calculator
    ```
3.  **Run**: Execute the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./factorial_calculator
    ```
